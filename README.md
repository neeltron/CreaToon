# CreaToon
Designing each and every scene for a Comic or even a small comic strip can be hectic, especially when the inspiration is taken from real-world scenarios. It may take hours or days to draw and color them. CreaToon is an online tool, that you can use to convert real-world images into their cartoonified versions, like the ones you see around in comics. It can be used for something from creating your next profile picture to creating background images for your comics to give you a kickstart.
